# Precompiled version of libraries

Tired of getting the tests failing because some needed library was moved elsewhere, i'm copying here some pre-compiled artifact we need to compile/test `licensecc`

## openssl

 * openssl-dev-1.0.2s-x86_64-win-mingw-w64.zip: pre-compiled version of openssl for mingw. Downloaded from [TeskaLabs](https://teskalabs.blob.core.windows.net/openssl/openssl-dev-1.0.2s-x86_64-win-mingw-w64.zip)
